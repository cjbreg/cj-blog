# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

## What I'm Building

I'm creating a simple static blog using:

- **React** for the UI
- **Vite** for blazing fast builds
- **Markdown** for writing posts
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting

## Code Example

Here's some code:

const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);## Images

You can add images like this (add a `demo.png` to this folder):

![Demo image](./demo.png)

That's it for now. More posts coming soon!
